# Frontend Deployment Guide

## Configuration Complete ✅

Your frontend has been successfully configured to connect to your deployed backend at:
**https://gen-ai-exchange-backend.onrender.com/**

## Environment Files Created

1. **`.env`** - For development and general use
2. **`.env.production`** - Specifically for production builds

Both files contain:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://gen-ai-exchange-backend.onrender.com
```

## Building for Production

To build the frontend for production deployment, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist/` folder with the production-ready files.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Environment variables will be automatically loaded from `.env.production`

### Option 2: Vercel
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Framework preset: Vite
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Output directory: `dist`
5. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_URL=https://gen-ai-exchange-backend.onrender.com`

### Option 3: Render

2. Environment: Static Site
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`

### Option 4: GitHub Pages
1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `dist/` folder contents to your GitHub Pages repository

## Local Testing with Production Backend

Your local development server is now configured to use the production backend.
You can test it by running:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` but will connect to your production backend.

## Verification

✅ Backend connection tested and working
✅ Environment variables configured
