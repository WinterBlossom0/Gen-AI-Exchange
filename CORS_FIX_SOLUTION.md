# üî• URGENT FIX: Frontend-Backend Connection Issue

## üö® **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
Your frontend `gen-ai-exchange-legal-agent.onrender.com` cannot connect to backend because of **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** restrictions.

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION APPLIED**
I've updated your `backend/main.py` file to include your frontend domain in the CORS allowed origins.

## üõ†Ô∏è **WHAT WAS CHANGED**
```python
# OLD (Only localhost allowed)
DEV_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:5173",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
    # ... other localhost entries
]

# NEW (Frontend domain added)
DEV_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:5173",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
    "http://localhost:5174",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5174",
    "http://localhost:4173",
    "http://127.0.0.1:4173",
    # Production frontend domain added
    "https://gen-ai-exchange-legal-agent.onrender.com",
]
```

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### Step 1: Push Backend Changes
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd "C:\Users\Hp\OneDrive - Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal\Desktop\Hackathons\Gen-AI-Exchange"

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit the fix
git commit -m "Fix CORS: Add frontend domain to allowed origins"

# Push to your backend branch (usually main)
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Backend on Render
1. Go to your **backend** deployment on Render
2. Click **"Manual Deploy"** or wait for auto-deploy
3. Monitor deployment logs for success

### Step 3: Test Connection
After backend redeploys:
1. Visit: https://gen-ai-exchange-backend.onrender.com/health
2. Should return: `{"status": "ok"}`
3. Test your frontend again

## üîç **VERIFICATION STEPS**

### Test 1: Backend Health Check
```bash
curl "https://gen-ai-exchange-backend.onrender.com/health"
```
Expected: `{"status": "ok"}`

### Test 2: Frontend Connection
1. Go to: https://gen-ai-exchange-legal-agent.onrender.com
2. Upload a test PDF
3. Should now work without connection errors

### Test 3: Browser Network Tab
1. Open F12 Developer Tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try file upload
4. Should see successful API calls to your backend

## ‚ö° **QUICK COMMANDS TO RUN**

Execute these in PowerShell:
```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "C:\Users\Hp\OneDrive - Shri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal\Desktop\Hackathons\Gen-AI-Exchange"

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS: Add frontend domain to allowed origins"

# Push to backend (assuming main branch)
git push origin main
```

## üéØ **EXPECTED RESULT**

After these changes:
- ‚úÖ Frontend can connect to backend
- ‚úÖ File uploads work
- ‚úÖ Contract analysis functions properly
- ‚úÖ No more "Failed to analyze" errors

## üÜò **IF STILL NOT WORKING**

### Additional Checks:
1. **Backend Sleep**: Visit backend URL to wake it up
2. **Environment Variables**: Verify `VITE_API_URL` is correct in Render
3. **Network Issues**: Try from different browser/device

### Alternative CORS Fix:
If the specific domain doesn't work, try allowing all origins (less secure):
```python
allow_origins=["*"]  # Allows all origins (use temporarily for testing)
```

## üìã **STATUS CHECKLIST**

- [x] CORS configuration updated
- [ ] Changes committed to git
- [ ] Backend redeployed on Render
- [ ] Frontend connection tested
- [ ] File upload functionality verified

**Follow the deployment steps above to complete the fix!** üöÄ
